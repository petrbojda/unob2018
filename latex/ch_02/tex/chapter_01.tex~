\section{Introduction}


\marginpar{\textcolor{txt_blue}{Definition}} 
It is well known fact, the Doppler effect is a shift in a frequency of a wave radiated, reflected or received by an object in motion. 
   
\marginpar{\textcolor{txt_blue}{Monostatic Radar System Doppler Shift}} 
For the monostatic radar configuration we are supposed to compute two--way doppler shift. The expression can be seen in formula (\ref{eq:ds}) bellow. 

\begin{equation}
f_D = \frac{2 \cdot v_r}{\lambda} \label{eq:ds}
\end{equation}


\section{Assignment A}
Your task is to prove that the equation (\ref{eq:ds}) is true. Look at the picture \ref{fig:compress}. It presents how the wavelength of the radio-wave is being compressed due to the motion of the radar and target.\footnote{Assume the aircraft on the left side of the picture carries the radar, the aircraft on the right is the target.}

  \caption{ Compression of the wavelength due to motion of the aircrafts.\label{fig:compress}}
\end{figure}

\marginpar{\textcolor{txt_blue}{Hint}}
Try to understand and to express how the two--way distance is being changed when both radar and target are approaching each other. Then use it to find wavelength of the received signal.

\section{Assignment B}
Using the equation (\ref{eq:ds}) compute the frequency of the received signal for the scenario from the picture \ref{fig:situation}.

\end{figure}

\marginpar{\textcolor{txt_blue}{Parameters}}
The first aircraft \textsl{A1} carying the monostatic radar is flying at altitude 5000 meters. The altitude of the target, aircraft \textsl{A2}, is 3000 meters. Both aircrafts are maintaining their altitude -- they are flying in parallel with the ground. The velocity of the \textsl{A1} is 500 km per hour, the velocity of the \textsl{A2} is 700 km per hour. Radar has measured a time delay between the moment when it transmitted the pulse and the moment when the echo is received is 100 $\mu$s. The carrier frequency of the radio--wave transmitted by the radar is 10 GHz.
